<p>Here's the stuff that I had with me when I arrived at <a href="http://rmozone.org">Rob</a>'s place on June 19, 2014.</p>

<p>Most of the stuff is in the backpack.</p>

<p>But before I show you what's in there, let's see what else I have.</p>

<p>One jacket pocket contains some cashews. The other contains a power cable for my laptop computer.</p>

<p>You've seen everything that isn't in the backpack, so now let's open the backpack.</p>

<p>I keep floss, toothpaste, laundry detergent, sunscreen, shampoo, lip balm, and maybe some other things in this bottom pocket.</p>

<p>Now let's open the side pocket.</p>

<p>I'll neaten up the bottom pocket so you can see what's in it.</p>

<p>Among is contents is another bag, a <a href="">Ribz Front Pack</a>. It's empty; I just have it in case I ever acquire more things.</p>

<p><img src="unpack-21-removing-frontpack.jpg" alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>These bags contain dirty clothes.</p>

<p><img src="unpack-22-removing-laundry.jpg" alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>There's also an envelope with money of other currencies.</p>

<p>Here I'm taking some underwear out of my bag.</p>
